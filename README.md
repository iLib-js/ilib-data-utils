## Release Notes

### v1.1.0

- added localeMergeAndPrune which uses the Utils.getSublocales to build
  the locale hiearchy first, and merge and prune based on the locales.
  This echoes the way that ilib loads locale data files.
  The older mergeAndPrune only merges from root -> lang -> 
  lang-script -> lang-script-region
  Specifically, it did not include the und-region locale in the hierarchy
  which means it was not merging and pruning the same way that ilib
  was loading the data.

### v1.0.0

- Initial version
